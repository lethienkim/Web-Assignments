        <h3>1. What is a server-side program? What is a client-side program?</h3>
        <p>
         A server-side program is a program that runs on a server computer and responds to requests from client computers. It typically involves processing requests, accessing databases, performing calculations, and generating dynamic content that is then sent back to the client.
         Examples of server-side programming languages include PHP, Python with frameworks like Django or Flask, Ruby on Rails, Node.js, and Java with frameworks like Spring.
        </p>
        <p>
         On the other hand, a client-side program is a program that runs on the client's computer or device, typically within a web browser. It interacts with the user interface, handles user inputs, and may perform some processing or manipulation of data locally.
         Client-side programs are often written in languages like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. They can also utilize client-side frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, and Vue.js to build more complex and interactive web applications.

        <h3>3.	What is the difference between asynchronously loading a script file and deferring the loading of the script file?</h3>
            <p>Asynchronously loading a script file and deferring the loading of a script file are two different approaches to how scripts are loaded and executed in a web page:</p>
            <p>a.	Asynchronously Loading a Script File: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>When a script is loaded asynchronously, it means that the script is downloaded in the background while the HTML parsing continues.</li>
                <li>As soon as the script is downloaded, it's executed, which means it can interrupt the HTML parsing and execute immediately.</li>
                <li>Aâ€¢	Asynchronous loading is typically achieved by using the async attribute in the script tag, like this: <script async src="script.js"></script>.</li>
                <li>The main advantage of asynchronous loading is that it allows the browser to continue parsing and rendering the HTML without waiting for the script to be downloaded and executed.
                This can improve page load performance, especially for scripts that are not critical for initial page rendering. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>b.	Deferring the Loading of a Script File: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Deferring the loading of a script file means delaying its execution until after the HTML content has been parsed and rendered.</li>
                <li>The script is still downloaded in the background, but it's not executed until the HTML parsing is complete.</li>
                <li>Deferring the loading of a script file is typically achieved by using the defer attribute in the script tag, like this: <script defer src="script.js"></script>.</li>
                <li> main advantage of deferring script loading is that it ensures scripts don't block the rendering of the page,
                but they still execute in the order they appear in the HTML document after the HTML parsing is complete. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
               In summary, the main difference is in when the script is executed relative to the HTML parsing process. Asynchronous loading allows the script to execute as soon as it's downloaded,
               potentially interrupting the HTML parsing process, while deferring the loading of a script ensures that it's executed only after the HTML parsing is complete, without blocking rendering.

    <h3>4. Provide code to insert the following comment text in a JavaScript file:</h3>
    <pre>

        showClock();

            var mins = (hrs - Math.floor(hrs)) * 60;
            var secs = (mins - Math.floor(mins)) * 60;
        
            // Step g: Display the time left until New Year's at 9 p.m.

        <h3>5.	Provide the command to display an alert dialog box with the message &ldquo;Happy New Year!&rdquo;:</h3>

        <p>
         The JavaScript command WINDOW.ALERT("Page Loaded"); will display an alert dialog box with the message "Page Loaded".
        </p>
        <p>
         However, there is a syntax error in the command. In JavaScript, object properties and methods are case-sensitive. Therefore, it should be window.alert("Page Loaded"); 
         instead of WINDOW.ALERT("Page Loaded");.
        </p>
        <p>
         This command will trigger an alert dialog with the message "Page Loaded" when executed.</p

        <h3>7. What is a breakpoint and why would you use a breakpoint in debugging your code?</h3>
        <p>
         Breakpoints are essential tools in software development for pausing the execution of a program at specific points in the code. They provide developers with valuable insights into the program's behavior by allowing them to inspect variables, understand program flow, and identify bugs more effectively.
         By pausing execution, developers can analyze the state of the program at that moment, making it easier to diagnose issues and track down the source of errors. Breakpoints also enable developers to test specific conditions, analyze performance, and optimize code for better efficiency.
         Overall, breakpoints play a crucial role in debugging by empowering developers to understand and improve the functionality and performance of their code.
